# SPACE RACE

The Space Race is a game designed by Andrea Khoury and Ian Graham-Martinez simulating the physics of gravity and orbitals in space.

This game allows the user to drive their own spaceship in space towards Earth. Using Control keys A, D, Left Shift, and the space bar, you can navigate your ship throughout space by powering forwards, backwards, or applying a torque to move sideways.

The goal of this game is the end up in the correct orbit of Earth. Navigate the rocket until you think you've correctly landed in a close enough orbit of Earth, and click done when you think you have it. If the rocket can orbit around Earth 3 times, you win!

Enjoy!
