	<h2><b>A Long Time Ago, in a Galaxy Far, Far Away...</b></h2>
	<p>
		...Just kidding. You're actually right here in the Milky Way. Welcome to the Space Race,
		where you can live your dreams (or nightmares) of finally becoming an astronaut! You are
		piloting a magical rocket (that does not run on fuel) that was set to explore Mercury. You
		succeeded your mission, but as you get ready to take off and head back to Earth, you realize
		your connection with NASA has been cut off! You must get back in Earth’s orbit to regain communication.
		Your goal is to make it safely into one of Earth’s orbits, making it possible
		to sustain connection. Good luck, captain!
	</p>
	<h2><b>Let's get physical. </b></h2>
	<p>
		On the bottom left of your screen, you'll see a small blue box with some numbers inside. Each
		number will be a measure of some physical factor you must take in consideration while playing
		our game. The small box, named the Stox (Stats-Box), will display gravitational acceleration,
		velocity, speed, angular velocity, distance to the planet, and more.
	</p>
	<h2><b>Instructions</b></h2>
	<p>
		Use the "A" and "D" keys to steer left and right, respectively. Use the space button to advance, and the left shift key to reverse.
		Be sure to observe the Stox! Use the Enter key to ender landing mode, which will relinquish control of the rocket.
		Make 3 laps around the target in landing mode to win the game!
